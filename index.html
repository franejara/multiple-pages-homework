    <h1>Manjar</h1>
    <p>
      Manjar blanco (Spanish pronunciation: [maŋˈxaɾ ˈblaŋko]), also known as
      manjar de leche or simply manjar, is a term used in Spanish-speaking area
      of the world in reference to a variety of milk-based delicacies.[1] In
      Spain the term refers to blancmange, a European delicacy found in various
      parts of the continent as well as the United Kingdom. In the Americas
      (South America primarily) it refers to a sweet, white spread or pastry
      filling made with milk. This term is sometimes used interchangeably with
      dulce de leche or cajeta in Latin America but these terms generally refer
      to delicacies prepared differently from those just described. Related
      dishes exist by other names in other countries, such as tembleque in
      Puerto Rico. In Portuguese-speaking countries the dish is known as manjar
      branco.
