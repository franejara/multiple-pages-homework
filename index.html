        "Manjar blanco (Spanish pronunciation: [maŋˈxaɾ ˈblaŋko]), also known as
        manjar de leche or simply manjar, is a term used in Spanish-speaking
        area of the world in reference to a variety of milk-based delicacies.[1]
        In Spain the term refers to blancmange, a European delicacy found in
        various parts of the continent as well as the United Kingdom. In the
        Americas (South America primarily) it refers to a sweet, white spread or
        pastry filling made with milk. This term is sometimes used
        interchangeably with dulce de leche or cajeta in Latin America but these
        terms generally refer to delicacies prepared differently from those just
        described. Related dishes exist by other names in other countries, such
        as tembleque in Puerto Rico. In Portuguese-speaking countries the dish
        is known as manjar branco." - Wikipedia
